Welcome to Free Food UGA! We created this website in the UGA 2022 Hackathon
because we want to provide UGA students and faculty a quick, simple, and seamless way to find free food around campus. 
Our goal is to benefit the UGA communtiy by promoting food giveaways and supporting local sustainability by reducing food waste.

In order for us to provide you with this amazing way to find free food, 
we made use of a firebase database to store the data we put in out markers,
structured our website in HTML, styled it nicely in CSS, and added lots of functionality with JavaScript. We also used many API websites such as Google Map API, Embedded API, GCP, Node.js, and a NoSQL database.  

Go Dawgs!
